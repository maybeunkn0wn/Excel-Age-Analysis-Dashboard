**Excel Age Analysis Dashboard Overview**

This project demonstrates my ability to work with Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The task was part of the HR People Analytics course offered by AIHR and focuses on workforce analysis based on age, education, department, and gender. Starting with a simulated dataset, I created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that highlights key workforce metrics.

The project reflects my passion for HR Analytics and showcases skills like data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dynamic charting with slicers.

**Project Steps**


**1. Data Collection**

The source data is a simulated dataset provided by AIHR as part of the HR People Analytics course.

The raw dataset is available as the following xlsx file: 
"A1 - Excel_Raw Data Set.xlsx".

The work itself is available as the following xlsx file: 
"A2 - Excel_AGE_ANALYSIS_Dasbhoard.xlsx".


**2. Data Cleaning**

Data cleaning involved the following steps:

a. Handling Missing Data: Removed or filled in missing values.

b. Standardization: Ensured consistency in formatting for key variables (e.g., department names, educational levels).

c. Removal of Duplicates: Checked for and removed duplicate records.

d. Preparation for Analysis: Added definitions for educational levels (1 = Below College, 2 = College, 3 = Bachelor, 4 = Master, 5 = Doctor).



**3. Data Analysis**

Analysis focused on identifying patterns and trends in the workforce:

Linear Data Distribution: Examined the age and education distributions across departments.
Education Levels: Mapped educational categories using labels (e.g., 1 = Below College, 2 = College, etc.).
Interactive Pivot Tables: Leveraged Excel's pivot table feature to organize data efficiently.

Key Insight: The dataset shows a linear distribution of age across various categories.


**4. Dashboard Creation**

Created an interactive dashboard using Excel, featuring:

a. Slicers: 

To filter data by age, education, department, and gender dynamically.

b. Dynamic Charts: 
Visual representations of key workforce metrics, by:

year; age; Educational Field; Education; Department; Gender.

The dashboard allows easy navigation and quick insights into workforce demographics.

You can find the dashboard in the dashboard sheet of the file "A2 - Excel_AGE_ANALYSIS_Dashboard.xlsx".

Dashboard design



**Motivation**
This project was motivated by my passion for data and People Analytics. My goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard that could be used by HR professionals to understand workforce age distribution and other key metrics.



> **Challenges:** This was my first projects (2021) and attempt at visualizing data with slicers and dashboard. From this experience I have learned a lot more on how to improve data visualization. The challenges were linked with the objective itself: to represent graphically the workforce, in particular the ageism phenomenon of the employees. The analysis itself is not too complex and was aimed to simply help HR business partner/ Manager to get a grasp of the current company population through Excel.


**Future improvement:**

Improve the analysis: Adding more layers of analysis to the project itself.
Expand the Scope: analyzing additional metrics like engagement, job involvement, and satisfaction.
Include Predictive Analysis: Using techniques like Markov Chains to project workforce evolution over time.
Broader Visualizations: Incorporating more data points from the dataset into the dashboard.
